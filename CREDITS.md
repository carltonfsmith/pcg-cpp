## Total-Random Improvements

### 7. Modern CMake Build System
- **Author:** [Total-Random](https://github.com/Total-Random)
- **Description:** Comprehensive CMake integration with `find_package` support and automated testing via `ctest`.

### 8. MSVC Compatibility Fixes
- **Author:** [Total-Random](https://github.com/Total-Random)
- **Description:** Resolved several MSVC-specific issues:
  - `C2678` (ambiguous operator) in `set_stream` and `operator>>`.
  - `C4458` (declaration of 'is_mcg' hides class member).
  - `C1090` (PDB API call failed) during parallel builds.
  - `C4127` (conditional expression is constant) in template code.
